The following is a list of genral prompts given to chatgpt 4 model. This whole research is done on the basis of what GPT-4o mini would strucutre
the best way to use it self to evaluate as a fuzzer.

The intial quesiton was the types of API to target, hoping to find simmilar groups where thet can be tested.
- The next is to create programs of individual API's to test
- Following closely is finding errors and then putting through a cycle of mutations to uncover certian bugs
    - mutation methods:
        - arguments
        - prefix
        - suffix
        - method
- Lastly comparing this on a CPU vs GPU level





Propmpts used for torch.mm:
