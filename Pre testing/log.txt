First intial strategy is to test the most common API's, by intially prompting chat gpt the following "what are the top 4 common apis in pytorch?"

The output presents the following:
torch.nn:
    This module contains classes and functions to create neural networks. It includes layers, loss functions, and activation functions, among other tools 
necessary for building and training deep learning models.

torch.optim:
    This module provides various optimization algorithms, such as SGD, Adam, and RMSprop, to optimize the parameters of the neural networks. These 
optimizers adjust the weights of the model during training based on the calculated gradients.

torch.autograd:
    This is PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine. It tracks operations on tensors and automatically computes gradients during the backward pass,
which is essential for training neural networks.

torch.utils.data:
    This module is used for data loading and preprocessing. It provides classes like Dataset and DataLoader to help in efficiently loading, batching,
and transforming datasets, which is crucial for training models on large-scale data.
