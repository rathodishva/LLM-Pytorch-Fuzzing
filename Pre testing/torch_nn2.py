# the prompt used for this "fix sections of code with bugs in this code" by sumbitting file torch_nn.py

# explination of why and what code was changed form gpt
# 1.
# Issue: The code in this section is correct. The torch.randn(0, 10) tensor is valid, and the linear layer
# handles it by producing an output tensor of shape (0, 5). No changes are needed here.
# Output: This will print an empty tensor of shape (0, 5).

# 2. 
# Issue: There's a typo in the variable name input_data ("not_a_tensosr" should be "not_a_tensor").
# Fix: Correct the typo in the string "not_a_tensosr".

# 3.
# Issue: The code in this section is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the way the input tensor is constructed.
#  The input tensor is supposed to be 2D (e.g., shape (1, 10)), but the provided code creates a tensor with an invalid shape due to the way the list is constructed.
# Fix: Adjust the list inside the torch.tensor() call to ensure a valid 2D tensor shape.

# 4. 
# Issue: The code attempts to create a Conv2d layer with a negative number of input channels (in_channels=-3), which is invalid.
# Fix: There is no fix needed, as the purpose of this test is to verify that an error is raised correctly.

# 5.
# Issue: The code in this section is correct. The Linear layer is initialized with NaN values, and the output tensor will contain NaNs as a result.
# Output: This will print a tensor filled with NaN values.

# 6.
# Issue: The code attempts to pass target indices that are out of the valid range for CrossEntropyLoss. The target tensor should 
# contain values between 0 and 4 for a 5-class problem (since the input tensor has a shape of (3, 5)).
# Fix: No fix is needed, as the purpose of this test is to ensure an error is raised when invalid target indices are used.
