Give me a list of 3 prompts to query chatgpt to fuzz test the pytorch API Neural Networks (torch.nn), ensure that it is pushing for edge cases
and aiming to uncover bugs

Unusual Layer Configurations:
"Write a script to initialize neural network layers (e.g., Linear, Conv2d, RNN) with extreme parameter values, such as unusually large or
 small input/output dimensions, stride, and kernel sizes. Test various inputs through these layers and check for unexpected errors or abnormal outputs."

Incompatible Layer Stacking:
"Create a neural network with a mix of incompatible or unusual layer sequences (e.g., a Conv2d layer followed by a Linear layer without
 reshaping). Attempt to forward random input through the model and log any layer incompatibility issues, shape mismatches, or runtime errors."

Edge Case Activations and Initializations:
"Generate a model with layers that use non-standard activations (e.g., extremely high negative values for ReLU input) and unusual weight
initializations (e.g., very large or very small weights). Pass a variety of inputs through the model, focusing on potential overflow, NaN
values, or divergence during training."
