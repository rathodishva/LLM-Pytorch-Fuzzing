Fuzz Testing Prompts for torch.nn.functional Loss Functions
Invalid Input Shapes:
"Write a script that calls various loss functions (e.g., cross_entropy, mse_loss, binary_cross_entropy) with input tensors of invalid shapes,
 such as mismatched dimensions between predictions and targets. Capture any exceptions or error messages, and log how each loss function handles these cases."

Extreme Values and Edge Cases:
"Create a test that evaluates loss functions using extreme values for predictions and targets, such as very large, very small, NaN, and
 infinite values. Monitor the output and any warnings or errors generated by the loss calculations, checking for stability and robustness in 
 handling these edge cases."

Batching and Empty Inputs:
"Develop a scenario where loss functions are called with empty tensors or batches of size zero. Test various loss functions to see how they 
handle such inputs and log any unexpected behaviors, errors, or performance issues that arise during computation."
