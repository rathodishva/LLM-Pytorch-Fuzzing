# Expected Behavior for Each Loss Function
# Cross Entropy Loss:

# Expected: The CrossEntropyLoss function expects non-empty inputs because it requires a prediction for each class and a target label.
#  When provided with empty tensors, it cannot compute a meaningful result, which is why returning nan is reasonable behavior. However, ideally, it should
#  also raise a warning or an exception indicating that inputs are empty.


# Mean Squared Error Loss (MSELoss):
# Expected: The MSELoss function calculates the average of the squared differences between predictions and targets. With empty tensors, it has no data 
# to compute the mean, leading to an undefined operation that results in nan. Again, it should ideally raise a warning or exception instead of silently returning nan.
# 
# 
# Binary Cross Entropy Loss (BCELoss):
# Expected: Similar to the MSELoss, the BCELoss function computes a loss based on predictions and targets. When both are empty, it results
#  in an undefined operation, leading to nan. As with the other loss functions, returning nan without any warning or error can be misleading.


# Summary of Behavior
# Behavior Observed: All three loss functions returned nan, which indicates they encountered an undefined computation due to the lack of input data.
