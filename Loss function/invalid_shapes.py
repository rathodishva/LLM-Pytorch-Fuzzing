# /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/loss.py:538: UserWarning: Using a target size (torch.Size([4, 3])) that is different to the input size (torch.Size([2, 3])). This will likely lead to incorrect results due to broadcasting. Please ensure they have the same size.
#   return F.mse_loss(input, target, reduction=self.reduction)
# cross_entropy: Error: Expected input batch_size (2) to match target batch_size (3).
# mse_loss: Error: The size of tensor a (2) must match the size of tensor b (4) at non-singleton dimension 0

# Analysis of the Output
# Warning Messages:
# The warning for mse_loss indicates that there is a mismatch between the target and input sizes, which can lead to broadcasting issues. This suggests that while the function can attempt to handle size mismatches through broadcasting, it may result in incorrect calculations. Fuzzing should target such scenarios to ensure that functions correctly handle or explicitly reject invalid input sizes.
# 
# Specific Error Messages:
# The error messages for cross_entropy, mse_loss, and binary_cross_entropy are informative and indicate how each function deals with size mismatches:
# 
# Cross Entropy: It clearly states that the expected input and target batch sizes must match, providing a clear guideline for proper usage.
# 
# MSE Loss: The error message is explicit about the dimensions that do not match, making it easy to identify the issue.
# 
# Binary Cross Entropy: The deprecation warning signals that the mismatch in sizes is not just an error but indicates a potential change in
# behavior in future versions of PyTorch, urging developers to ensure their input sizes match.
# 
# General Robustness:
# The way these loss functions respond to invalid inputs reflects a balance between flexibility (e.g., allowing broadcasting in some cases) and safety (e.g., raising clear errors). Fuzzing should continue to explore edge cases, such as incorrect input shapes, to ensure that these functions remain robust against unexpected or malicious inputs.
