#Output expection
# Since the tensors are empty, the addition and multiplication operations will not raise errors but will result in empty tensors


#Output:
# Tensor A: tensor([])
# Tensor B: tensor([])
# Result of Addition:
# tensor([])
# Result of Multiplication:
# tensor([])


# Out put matches expections
